# Learn from the original data!

I come to aware that most of the education is teaching you tools, concepts, opinions, theories, something behind the facts and reality. It seems facts are too obvious to teach.

In internet era, data is cheap and everywhere, but **high quality data is expensive and slowly accumulated**, which requires human effort to filter the noise and well-present. We build our models on these data. So I decide to pay special attention to these time-honored dataset.
